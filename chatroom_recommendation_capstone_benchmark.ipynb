coming up on organa major soon the empire must have gotten here first the planet has been totally blown away it would have taken thousand ships with lot more fire power than ve ever seen if the empire had new weapon that could do this would have heard something know about it well now you know the enemy is on the move we haven much time well ve brought you here what now we have to find he rebels what we re carrying belongs to them their bases are very well hidden all the power of the empire can find them do you know where they are no not anymore not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy was only paid to get you here and now you re here ll take my other five thousand and you re on your own ll leave you on the nearest system well for one reason we don have your other five thousand who going to pay me then think there are some things we should talk about beginning not to like you how much do you think she talking about million at least if this robot has information related to the destruction of organa major you ll be able to name the reward anything want now that interesting luke got point fear is their greatest defense doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on aquilae or sullust and what there is is most likely directed toward large scale assault this isn game you know kid you take the glory and the good intentions and ll take the reward fear is their greatest weapon not afraid of anything you have your father style you ve done very well not bad we re into the second perimeter they ll be coming out to blast us shortly was wondering if you had some kind of plan or are we going to try to blast our way in check your data banks for all the information you have on imperial procedures both of you will have to learn we re going to get in by studying imperial procedures don like it all right then we ll use your plan ll get the information and want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan shielded compartments what do you want with our scan proof lockers darth vader is on this system can feel him can feel the kiber crystal is that good or bad it not good unless could find the crystal then it could be very good don look at me just pilot got you here you ve got to do the rest there is greater risk in staying here you know if you don find the princess then the whole trip was for nothing wasn it not going out there that straight through the central core up toward the top of the city once you ve got her avoid the main transports they ll shut down immediately your only chance is through the service shafts there are no sensors there all right now get going you don have time hope you can remember everything we ll be back before you are old man may the force be with you put that thing away or you re going to get us all killed yes your highness ll let you open it then it won be too long before they figure out what happened to us this has turned into brilliant escape it could be worse here come six more grid two was this trip really necessary there are only three or four left chewbacca it time we showed them this isn the regulation cargo trawler all the data banks in artoo are still secure then think we re due the reward you offered and it had better be substantial after what we ve been through when artoo has been safely delivered to my forces you get your reward you have my guarantee what that little droid carrying that so blasted important the plans and specifications to battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness which we will determine from the data stored in artoo we captured the plans in raid on the imperial shipyards but we fell under attack before could get the data to safety so hid it in this artoo unit and sent him off where are you taking us now anyway the fourth moon of yavin ve given the coordinates to chewbacca better go see how he doing don see how we re going to find anything out here this terrain is hopeless did it occur to you they might find us we must hurry to the base we have little time before the death star arrives like to get paid before that eventually don plan to stick around for the fireworks what about us are we to wait forever is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that death star part of my reward is that be around to spend it have little time for your mercenary concerns but am grateful for the service you have given to our cause what is your price organa major is rebel system there will be quite few starfleet patrols between here and there it could be little tricky if you want to avoid them ten thousand that pretty steep we like to talk it over first you got yourself ship we can leave as soon as you re ready we have little business to take care of first but it shouldn take long we ll be back shortly who the pilot it automatic keep that thing close just in case if were you ve been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this force of others stuff may make for good religion but there is no substitute for good weapon at your side you don believe in the force sorcery believe in myself determine my destiny not some mystical energy field found it it just not there what are you saying you can we ve come this far we must find them why maybe you should just drop us off sure we can find someone willing to take the risk all right all right you ve got ship but where do we go from here they probably took her to find the hidden bases don see how we can find the rebels before she breaks the empire has already beat us out no it impossible no one and mean no one would venture anywhere near the alderaan system free booter not revolutionary you re aboard the wrong ship son maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us they probably don think anyone would dare try don you believe it well practice lot you re good with remotes but how are you against something living don know ve never fought anyone between his howling and your blasting everything in sight the entire city is going to know we re here good prefer straight fight to all this sneaking around this isn going to work why didn you say so before think did something has happened to them let try this way let try this way holy maker see threepio come in see threepio wonder where they are see threepio think she going to be all right not if this tunnel deadends is he afraid of the water no he smells something but we haven time to worry about it now watch it move back get chewbacca try to get around it ll draw it away it only light that doesn affect it solid things like rocks can hurt it fire above him move out of the way get to the ship come back here where are you going don pick up any life form concentration down there she better be right they must be shielded somehow sure the base is there well if it not we ll be facing that death star all by our lonesome you re good pilot ve learned lot from you wish you know but the chances for survival here just aren great enough in my book ve got what came for now ve got to get back to my ship noticed you were having

about it the empire must have gotten here first you might get your stuff together we ll be coming up on organa major soon well we ll see ben kenobi luke starkiller here is leading our expedition han solo captain of this vessel who in charge then keep it with you always you ll have more need of it than it will bring the force to you you ve already learned to feel it now you must learn to use it the kiber crystal not going alone you go after the princess am an old man and would be of little help must try to find the crystal what about the princess don get it but guess did block it see once you let yourself go you can do it you ll get it stop thinking and start feeling let yourself go can do it ll get hit try to feel it use the force can see how can fight didn say that but it appears to be logical alternative you mean we should go after her but she is the only link between us and the hidden bases he can find organa major what is it all you have to do is lose your thinking self don focus on anything let your body do your thinking you have to learn to act on what you feel not what you think if had the crystal it would be much easier you could feel the force immediately but for now let yourself go you ll pick it up and someday you ll have no need for that pistol either what do do rarely use it any more have the force the force is more powerful than any pistol you shouldn put too much faith in that weapon work on becoming aware of the force learn to feel its presence within you try to sense what it telling you it the only thing you can rely on are you sure you don need it yes the force something horrible has happened couldn see what it was or where it was but it was terrible terrible beyond description the cry of millions dying at once are you all right keep away fine fine what wrong what happening these are doubtful times the empire has grown bold in its disregard of the but she member of the twelve families how can they hold her doubt it it would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding know your feelings you best forget them it for your own good there will be no saving her from the prisons of alderaan it the heart of the sith the bogan force is the most heavy there when we get artoo message to them you think they ll try to rescue the princess he bluffing this is the last place shouldn we just take what we can get and think of something else five maybe let me handle it we don have that kind of money how much do you think can get for the speeder there are two halves of the force of others one is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it but the others half will kill you if you aren careful this negative side of the force is called the bogan which is where the expression came from and it is the part that is used by the dark lords to destroy their opponents both halves are always present the force is on your right the bogan is on your left the kiber crystal can amplify either one the crystal darth stole was the last one in the possession of the jedi when he joined the sith the power of the dark lords was completed like bogan weather or bogan times thought that was just saying they use the bogan force do the sith know the ways of the force yes it was black day one of my disciple took the crystal and became sith lord it was black day the few crystals that remain are in the possession of the sith lords on alderaan that how they ve become so powerful that where my father was killed had one but it was taken at the battle of condawn don you have kiber crystal when creature dies the force it generated remains the force is all around us it can be collected and transmitted through the use of kiber crystal it the only way to amplify the power of the force within you how can you store an energy field within you jedi power is measured by the amount of the force that is stored within him and have little of the force left in me but you re still powerful jedi you don need my help luke coming along to do what can but tired and depending on you to get us through it means you better get some rest we ll be leaving for mos eisley first thing in the morning the trip will be difficult and dangerous but it the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to organa major now go on what do you mean that is not human decision not your or mine could learn to feel it it surrounds you and radiates from you jedi can feel it flowing from him from here you mean generate an energy field let just say the force is something jedi warrior deals with it is an energy field in oneself power that controls ones acts yet obeys ones commands it is nothing yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes all living things generate this force field even you my father used to talk about the force of others but he never told me what it was you were right it is my responsibility the force of others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me not any more but the sith lords are involved whatever information this unit is carrying it must be awfully important they re probably looking for him no match for the sith this is jedi work this is your responsibility already know you think you re worthless recommend you learn to think of yourself in better light for what you believe you are is what you become haven been involved in anything like this for many years but you must can do it alone not at all like my father never make it afraid ve gotten too old for this sort of thing my father told me many stories about you he said if was ever in trouble to come here need your help know your intentions probably know much more about you than you realize in many ways you re lot like your father he was an indulgent man but clever warrior now what brings you out here assure you my intentions weren bad you could put it that way you saw through me know that not bendu officer not even startrooper but you are know your diary of the clone wars by heart my father know who you are stand up so that we can talk properly you re embarrassing me not that important am the son of annikin starkiller don see why don believe we ve ever met afraid it been long time since the white legions roamed the stars but have the memories you re general kenobi the jedi knight the commander of the white legions you might say part of the landscape here they call me ben kenobi who are you anyway of course bendu officer oh so you re warrior then luke starkiller guardian of the bendu you re lucky those tuskens didn boil you before they hung you out to dry they re not the friendly sort you best be moving on before they come back couldn we have tried to think of something else first sorry but that was the only way to get you down all of them altogether you seem to have gotten yourself into fine mess what happened what do you mean good morning do you mean that it is good morning for you or do you wish me good morning although it is obvious not having one or do you find that mornings in general are good good morning just be warned that things aren always as they seem especially the starforce recruiting posters at least you re doing something give anything to be in your position the academy is fantastic of course they won teach you anything about flying you don already know most of the instructors are very conservative pilots you can fly circles around them but there is lot on the scientific side that is down right amazing and you get lot of discipline but after you graduate don join the star force go free lance it the only way to get into the action can wait until my hitch is up but you always said things were so great at the academy what happened ll tell you luke and this is between you and me the star force isn all it cracked up to be frankly it bore and it going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral but there was lot of firing earlier that no battle kid they re just sitting there you look great the uniform and everything of course where you been kid forget it son yes sir but can get him blue five break off your cover attack it too late make your own run on the exhaust port do you copy luke what that right behind you blue leader ve got it blocked all right blue five does that glare bother you yes sir six hours huh well that your ship there you re blue five you stay glued to me don want any independent operations out there personally think it foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on job like this this is no joy ride we re going on yes sir was considered one of the best bush pilots on sullust ve also had six hours on the have you been checked out yes sir you re starkiller send out boarding party full assault gear we don get many visitors let take look at it send one squad up as close as we can make out it appears to be corellian gypsy vessel it not under power ll make report later should we alert the sith lords alert squad five but hold them until we know what it is no reply on any circuits it drifting on point twenty seven skew it not close enough to identify have little time for your mercenary concerns but am grateful for the service you have given to our cause what is your price what about us are we to wait forever is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that death star part of my reward is that be around to spend it like to get paid before that eventually don plan to stick around for the fireworks we must hurry to the base we have little time before the death star arrives did it occur to you they might find us don see how we re going to find anything out here this terrain is hopeless better go see how he doing the fourth moon of yavin ve given the coordinates to chewbacca where are you taking us now anyway we captured the plans in raid on the imperial shipyards but we fell under attack before could get the data to safety so hid it in this artoo unit and sent him off the plans and specifications to battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness which we will determine from the data stored in artoo what that little droid carrying that so blasted important when artoo has been safely delivered to my forces you get your reward you have my guarantee then think we re due the reward you offered and it had better be substantial after what we ve been through all the data banks in artoo are still secure chewbacca it time we showed them this isn the regulation cargo trawler there are only three or four left was this trip really necessary here come six more grid two it could be worse yes your highness ll let you open it then it won be too long before they figure out what happened to us this has turned into brilliant escape put that thing away or you re going to get us all killed thanks old buddy ll be with you in second noticed you were having some problems blue five thought help know but the chances for survival here just aren great enough in my book ve got what came for now ve got to get back to my ship you re good pilot ve learned lot from you wish you well if it not we ll be facing that death star all by our lonesome

only light that doesn affect it solid things like rocks can hurt it fire above him get chewbacca try to get around it ll draw it away watch it move back no he smells something but we haven time to worry about it now is he afraid of the water not if this tunnel deadends think she going to be all right see threepio come in see threepio wonder where they are see threepio let try this way holy maker something has happened to them let try this way think did why didn you say so before this isn going to work good prefer straight fight to all this sneaking around between his howling and your blasting everything in sight the entire city is going to know we re here don know ve never fought anyone you re good with remotes but how are you against something living well practice lot don you believe it maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us they probably don think anyone would dare try no it impossible no one and mean no one would venture anywhere near the

case if were you ve been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this force of others stuff may make for good religion but there is no substitute for good weapon at your side it automatic who the pilot we have little business to take care of first but it shouldn take long we ll be back shortly you got yourself ship we can leave as soon as you re ready that pretty steep we like to talk it over first organa major is rebel system there will be quite few starfleet patrols between here and there it could be little tricky if you want to avoid them ten thousand who is this what your operating the ah door jammed give us few minutes to get it fixed with four casualties no need everything under control we ll send squad up wookiee broke loose up here but we ve subdued him there is lot of damage and three no four casualties it would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are otherwise we ll be forced to destroy every suspicious system what waste no it too late we already tested it on organa major it appears your data never got through they ll find its weakness the death star has become operational there is no force in the universe that can stop us now it appears your ship had an accident will see to it that your death is duely reported there will be no one to save you this time you ll get no information from me you have no authority the council can hold me enough already know about the data you ve intercepted but its too late whatever information you ve gathered will be destroyed you will come to know such suffering as only the master of the bogan force can provide if you re as good pilot as you are swordsman we re the ones who have been rewarded don know guess never thought about it just want to help want to be in on the attack want my own ship and you he ll be well cared for are there medical facilities on yavin there ll be time for that later now let get out of here am luke starkiller at your service you re safe we ve come to get you out of here just relax what is it what going on where are we your father dead don ever forget who taking care of you giving you food giving you shelter and giving you the allowance in the first place if you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here you won last very long don want another word finish your dinner then finish cleaning those droids you used my savings you stole my savings if my father were here said we see and as it is was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new droids when you ve saved it up again ll let you go but you promised ve saved enough money and now you have the extra help you promised you ll check the condensing unit first and you re not going to bed until those droids are completely cleaned up will but ll have enough time to transmit my application first first thing tomorrow morning you re going to check those condensing units on the south ridge consider it an honor thank you sir your kindness is greatly appreciated but if it at all possible artoo and would like to remain in your service threepio shut down all garbage mashers on your level do you copy threepio shut down all garbage are you there sir we re going holy maker threepio forgot see threepio do you copy wait minute slow down that better they re where they what they are oh no we re going to be mashed into conduit before this is over good we re right above you stand by for the moment we re in the main hangar artoo is trying to plug into the system now are you safe afraid we re not plugged in at the moment sir we ve had some problems you re back what happened never mind what going on read you sir see threepio do you copy send feed back into the control sensors in that detention block level five detention block cell she still alive know sir but it the principle of the thing let him have it you re winning anyway it doesn make any difference well ask him tell him we need five thousand sir have couple of extra circuits perhaps they might bring something think we re going to need them blast it no you re not what kind of talk is that can make it you go on master luke it doesn make sense for you to risk yourself on my account done for can you stand we ve got to get out of here before those tuskens come back what happened sorry sir must have taken bad step well don know what to do now we ll just have to head inland and see if we can find settlement if you don mind my saying so sir don see how anyone could live in this forsaken place according to my father tapes this is the spot where general kenobi lives but the instruments just don match up with the landscape there is no doubt about it we re lost several think there is not much to tell not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories not at making them interesting anyway tell me where you ve been am going to become startrooper and fight in the wars my father was jedi were you in many battles that how we came to be in your service if you take my meaning you ve been in the counter wars against the empire indeed sir sometimes amazed we re in as good shape as we are what with the rebellion and all there lot of carbon scoring here it looks like you boys have seen lot of action thank you sir see threepio human cyborg relations and this is my counterpart artoo detoo that all right there is nothing anyone can do about it you can call me luke sorry sir only droid and not very knowledgeable of such things not on this system anyway as matter of fact not even sure which system we re on not unless you could get me into the military academy at
